# Eyes Movement excercise
This was my second excersise working with and creating elements in the DOM. I had to create two eyes and two pupils that were controlled  by the mouse. I had to write logic to make the eyes functional. 
## How to get started
clonefiles 
- Index.html
- eyes.js
- styles.css
## Future improvements
- would like to add eylashes to make the eyes blink
- to center the eyes
- create a face
